IMPLEMENTATION:

The implementation is quite simple. 
First, the command string is converted into an array of strings by splitting it via spaces.
Then this array is sent into launch method.
Launch method decides if piping is needed or not and appropriate method is called.
When piping is not needed, simply a child process is created and then replaced by the execution of command entered.
when piping is needed, multiple child processes are created whose inputs and ouput are connected via pipe.
Upon termination, a custom handler is created for sigint to display the details.
